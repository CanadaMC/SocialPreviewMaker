# SocialPreviewMaker

Simple app to create GitHub social preview images.

Generated images are meant to be used as social preview images which means they perfectly fit inside the template.

⚠️ This image generator uses the [Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) so make sure you have it to get the best result!
