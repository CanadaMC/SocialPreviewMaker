# SocialPreviewMaker
Simple app to create GitHub social preview images.

Generated images are meant to be used as social preview images which means they perfectly fit inside the template.

⚠️ This image generator uses the [Inter font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) & the Ponton font (Ponton Black italic Caps) so make sure you have them to get the best result!

# Example

You can run the example script by doing

```sh
# Windows
.\example\example.bat

# Linux
.\example\example.sh
```

And here is the result of the example script

<img src="example/example.png" alt="Example image" width="640">
